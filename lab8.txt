Question 1
----------
I can see the phaser canvas. When I drag the rabbit around in another window 
they both move at the same time. (Achieved using websockets.)


Question 2
----------
Typescript uses static, strongly-typed typing whereas javascript is dynamic 
and weakly typed. This makes Typescript easier to debug, if a bit harder to 
setup. 
Typescript is a superset of javascript.
Typescript is compiled; javascript is interpreted.
Typescript is probably better for large projects.


Question 3
----------
A bundler is like a cross language compiler for javascript; higher-level 
languages are "transpiled" into JS. 
Apparently this is necessary because there are a ton of derivative flavours
of javascript and CSS that need to work in tandem.
It also serves the files on a local HTTP server (with live reloading).
There's also some other things it can do to prepare JS code for production.
Parcel in particular boasts a lightweight environment with minimal setup.


Question 4
----------
It has 4 values. From MDN:
0 - CONNECTING - "Socket has been created. The connection is not yet open."
1 - OPEN - "The connection is open and ready to communicate."
2 - CLOSING - "The connection is in the process of closing."
3 - CLOSED - "The connection is closed or couldn't be opened."


Question 5
